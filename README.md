# Banana Farm Shenanigans

This project is all about the [Banana Farm](<https://www.bloonswiki.com/Banana_Farm_(BTD6)>) from [BTD6](<https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Mobile/Bloons-TD-6.html>). The end goal is to have the program be capable of finding the optimal farming strategy through brute force, including, well, not using quite all the money for farming, so a defense can be established.


### TODOs:
- add bloon cash per round (semi-done, still needs some more testing)
    - maybe store the data in a seperate file? (done)
- maybe store all constants in seperate files and load them from there?
- add x/3/x, x/4/x, x/5/x farm
    - this one gets increasingly complicated as there are more options for actions than any other farm due do deposit/collect
    - also the middle path has like 3 MKs attached to it
    - Benjamin's Bank Hack shakes things up, too, as it makes a significant difference, but Benjamin is not implemented at all rn
- overhaul/replace the "strategy method" system cuz the current one is a recipe for spaghetti

### Ideas for new stuff:
- Add Monkey Village (x/x/4 buff and x/x/5 cash generation)
- Add Benjamin (general cash generation and buffs)
- Add Bucaneer cash generation and Bucaneer-focused farming strategies
